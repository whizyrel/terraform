# Terraform

I have used shell scripts to write the configurations. This setup contains just a shell script for Hashicorp Terraform.

## Shell Script

The respective shell script files is in this [file](./terraform.sh)

## Usage

Simply run the shell scripts. Feel free to look in. If version is specified, `1.1.7` is used for Terraform.

- PASSWORD: Root User Password

```bash
chmod +x terraform.sh
./terrafrom.sh $PASSWORD
```
